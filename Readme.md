We recommend to scan all tasks before the start.
Start from any task in any order.
Skip task if you feel it too hard.

You may use docs:

1. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
2. https://nodejs.org/en/docs/
3. https://regex101.com/
4. https://rxjs.dev/

Run scripts via: `ts-node tasks/<file>.ts` in the terminal below.
And don't forget to save the file before with Ctrl+S (or the save button).

Thanks for your time and good luck!
